# Roadmap

**This file is an index, not a source of truth.** Every fact here lives somewhere else — a spec, a
plan, `TODO.md`, or a design decision — and this page only records *status, ordering, and why the
order is what it is*. If you find a detail stated here and nowhere else, it is in the wrong file.
(The benchmark page had exactly this drift and it is what `deploy/bench/render_page.py` now exists to
prevent.)

## The current thread

Everything in flight traces to one root cause found on 2026-07-23: **the tool was reporting `0` for
things it never measured.** Most invariant violations were evaluated inside the target JVM, logged,
and then discarded because the response had already committed before the boundary could attach its
reporting header — 97.3% of Roller's responses, 75% of JSPWiki's, 0% of JPetStore's. That last figure
is why the defect hid for so long: JPetStore is the outlier that made the tool look functional.

Evidence: `bench-results/header-loss-2026-07-23/`, `bench-results/violation-logs-2026-07-23/`
(9,023 recovered violations), and the "Follow-ups from the 2026-07-23 benchmark campaign" section of
`TODO.md`.

## Ladder

| | What | State | Blocked by | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DD-040** | Trustworthy measurement — a reported zero means "checked and clean" | **in review** as [#94](https://github.com/ianp94/basquin/pull/94); all 7 tasks done, acceptance run recorded as **FAILED** with two documented residuals | — | [spec](superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-trustworthy-measurement-design.md) · [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-trustworthy-measurement.md) · [evidence](../bench-results/dd040-acceptance-2026-07-23/) |
| **DD-039** | Multi-step exploration — session carry across redirects | specced; spec amended with **per-hop accumulation**, and it now owns DD-040's residuals | blocked on #94 | [spec](superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-redirect-session-carry-design.md) · [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-redirect-session-carry.md) |
| **DD-041** | Clustered exploration across replicas | wanted, not specced | DD-040 | `TODO.md` |
| **DD-042** | A load-mode concurrency oracle | designed, not specced | independent | `TODO.md` |

### Why that order

- **DD-040 first** because nothing else can be *measured* until it lands. Re-running benchmarks,
  proving DD-039 works, or trusting a DD-042 finding all depend on the reporting channel being
  honest. It also has to land before DD-039 mechanically: both rewrite the core of
  `CoverageGuidedRun.request()`, and DD-039's per-hop records are only retrievable once the channel
  exists — the final hop of a redirect chain is exactly the committed-risk hop.
- **DD-039 now also owns DD-040's two measured residuals**, which is why it follows immediately: a
  method-changing redirect strips `X-Basquin-Req` (11.8% of Roller's violations went unreported), and
  a same-method hop across replicas re-uses the id on two pods so the §A.6 fan-out can return the
  wrong hop's measurement. Both dissolve once every hop carries its own id. See DD-040's
  `**Verified.**` block.
- **DD-041 after DD-040** because a distributed driver cannot rely on a response header it may not be
  the one to receive. DD-040 §A.6 already pre-empts the specific trap (the result store is per-JVM, so
  a poll through a Service VIP reaches a pod that never saw the request).
- **DD-042 is independent** and could jump the queue. Its latency-budget half is already inside
  DD-040's item B, so start there regardless.

### The division of labour these are converging on

- **Explore** finds serialized, per-request defects — invariant breaches, expensive inputs, cold
  cliffs — because it runs one clean iteration at a time under `ITERATION_LOCK`.
- **Load** is the only mode that produces real interleaving, so it is the only mode that can *expose*
  concurrency defects. DD-042 is what makes it able to *detect* them; today it counts and never
  asserts.

## Standing debts worth not forgetting

These are recorded in `TODO.md` with full evidence; listed here only so they are visible from one
place.

- Load mode has **no failure oracle** — two campaigns ran against a JSPWiki with two cores pinned and
  a dead NIO Poller, reported 2.1 rps / p50 5003 ms, and were marked **Completed**.
- `fireR` returns `-1` on a transport failure, which increments **neither** error counter.
- `heapDriftKb` is GC-phase noise (+381 MB on one run, **−194 MB** on another) — no drift figure is
  published, deliberately.
- The seeded JSPWiki pages are not actually served (`jspwiki.fileSystemPath` vs
  `jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir`).

## Findings we owe upstream

- **Apache JSPWiki 2.12.4** — unsynchronized `WeakHashMap` in `DefaultUserManager` causes a permanent
  100%-CPU spin; root-caused from bytecode and reproduced in ~60 s at concurrency 96. Report is
  written and ready to send: `bench-results/jspwiki/incident-2026-07-23-login-hang/ANALYSIS.md`.
- **MyBatis JPetStore** — `/actions/Order.action?listOrders=` NPEs for an unauthenticated caller, then
  NPEs again inside Stripes' own exception handler.
